					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The West Eifel Volcanic Field of western Germany, SW of the city of Bonn, is a dominantly Pleistocene group of 240 scoria cones, maars, and small stratovolcanoes covering an area of about 600 km2. The smaller, but better known, East Eifel Volcanic Field is about 40 km NE. Individual vents spread across a broad NW-SE-trending area extending about 50 km from the towns of Ormont on the NW to Bad Bertrich on the SE. Eruptions originated from a mantle plume through Devonian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Two-thirds of the volcanic centers in the field are scoria cones; lava flows have been produced from about half of them. About 30% of the centers are maars or tuff rings, many of which are occupied by lakes. About 230 eruptions have occurred during the past 730,000 years. The latest eruptions formed the Ulmener, Pulvermaar, and Strohn maars around the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene.</SimpleData>

Construction of the present-day Chaîne des Puys began about 70,000 years before present (BP), and was largely completed by the beginning of the Holocene. Holocene eruptions constructed lava domes such as the Puy de Dôme, whose growth was accompanied by pyroclastic flows, cinder cones that fed lengthy lava flows, and maars. The latest well-documented activity took place about 6000 BP near Besse-en-Chandesse and included the powerful explosions that formed the Lac Pavin maar. The dating of younger tephras has not yet been confirmed, and reports of historical eruptions as late as 1000 BP have been discredited.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The Vulsini volcanic complex in central Italy covers about 2,200 km2 at the northern end of the Roman Magmatic Province. Following lava extrusion and explosive eruptions that constructed the main complex, the 16-km-wide, lake-filled Bolsena caldera on the east and the 8 x 11 km Latera caldera on the west were formed during major Pleistocene explosive eruptions at about 0.3 and 0.16 million years ago, respectively. Five major Plinian fall deposits were erupted from vents at or near Latera caldera during the late Pleistocene. The latest major eruption formed unwelded pumice flows and welded airfall tuffs of the Pitigliano Formation, associated with collapse of the Vepe caldera about 166,000 years ago at the NW end of Latera caldera. Post-caldera volcanism produced scoria cones and lava flows from vents within and to the west of Latera caldera. Youthful-looking remnants of ash cones in Lake Bolsena may have given rise to a legend of a pre-historical fire-god, Volta. An historical report noted that &quot;a flame shot up near Volsini&quot; in 104 BCE.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The Colli Albani (Alban Hills) complex immediately SE of Rome contains a large Pleistocene stratovolcano with a 10 x 12 km caldera formed during an eruptive period with six major explosions that produced at least 280 km3 of ejecta between about 560,000 and 350,000 years ago. Subsequent eruptions occurred from a new 5-km-wide central cone and from many phreatomagmatic craters and cones within the Artemisio-Tuscolana caldera and on its outer flanks. The post-caldera eruptions have buried the western side of the caldera rim. The largest of the post-caldera craters is Lake Albano, a 2.5 x 4 km compound maar constructed at the WSW margin of the caldera in multiple stages dating back to about 69,000 years ago. The age of the most recent eruptions from the Albano maar is not known precisely; variable dates range from about 36,000 years ago to perhaps the Holocene, when several possibly non-volcanic lake overflow lahars occurred.  Reported historical eruptions during the Roman period are uncertain, but subsequent seismic swarms lasting up to two years have been recorded.</SimpleData>

Episodes of significant uplift and subsidence within the dominantly trachytic caldera have occurred since Roman times. The earliest known eruptive products are dated 47,000 years BP. The caldera formed following two large explosive eruptions, the massive Campanian ignimbrite about 36,000 BP, and the over 40 km3 Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT) about 15,000 BP. Following eruption of the NYT a large number of eruptions originated from widely scattered subaerial and submarine vents. Most activity occurred during three intervals: 15,000-9,500, 8,600-8,200, and 4,800-3,800 BP. The latest eruption were in 1158 CE at Solfatara and activity in 1538 CE that formed the Monte Nuovo cinder cone.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">One of the world&apos;s most noted volcanoes, Vesuvius (Vesuvio) forms a dramatic backdrop to the Bay of Naples. The historically active cone of Vesuvius was constructed within a large caldera of the ancestral Monte Somma volcano, thought to have formed incrementally beginning about 17,000 years ago. The Monte Somma caldera wall has channeled lava flows and pyroclastic flows primarily to the south and west. Eight major explosive eruptions have taken place in the last 17,000 years, often accompanied by large pyroclastic flows and surges, such as during the well-known 79 CE Pompeii eruption. Intermittent eruptions since 79 CE were followed by a period of frequent long-term explosive and effusive eruptions between 1631 and 1944. The large 1631 eruption produced pyroclastic flows that reached as far as the coast and caused great destruction. Many towns are located on the volcano&apos;s flanks, and several million people live within areas that could be affected by eruptions.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The Ischia volcanic complex forms a rectangular, 6 x 9 km island immediately SW of the Campi Flegrei area at the western side of the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000 years ago was followed by caldera formation. The high point on the island, Monte Epomeo, is a volcanic horst composed of the Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least 800 m of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows, and a major collapse of Mount Epomeo produced a large submarine debris-avalanche deposit. The latest eruption, in 1302 CE, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The mostly submerged Panarea volcanic complex lies about midway between Stromboli and Lipari in the eastern part of the Aeolian Islands. Panarea, the smallest island in the Aeolian Archipelago, lies on the western side of a shallow platform whose shelf margin is at about 130 m depth.  A series of small islands breach the surface to form the Central Reefs, the rim of a crater 2 km E of Panarea, whose shallow submerged floor contains Roman ruins.  The submerged Secca dei Pesci lava dome lies at the SE end of the platform, and the rhyolitic Basiluzzo lava dome rises 165 m above the surface at the NE end, along a ridge trending towards Stromboli volcano.  The complex was constructed in two main stages: an initial effusive activity phase that produced lava domes, and an explosive stage.  The youngest subaerial airfall-tephra deposits are dated to about 20,000 years ago; a date of less then 10,000 BP on a lava flow is uncertain. Vigorous hydrothermal activity has continued at fumarolic fields at several locations on the submerged platform; submarine hydrothermal explosions have occurred in historical time.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Lipari, the largest of the Aeolian Islands, is located immediately north of Vulcano Island. The irregular-shaped island contains numerous small stratovolcanoes, craters, and lava domes on a basement of submarine volcanic deposits. Lipari was formed in three major eruptive cycles, the first of which took place from about 223 to 188 thousand years ago (ka) from N-S-trending fissures on the western side of the island. The second eruptive period from about 102 to 53 ka included the formation of the Monte San Angelo and Costa d&apos;Agosto stratovolcanoes in the center of the island. The third eruptive cycle (40 ka to the present) included the Monte Guardia sequence, erupted at the southern tip of the island between about 22,600 and 16,800 years ago, and Holocene rhyolitic pyroclastic deposits and obsidian lava flows at the NE end of the island. The latest eruption, at Monte Pilato on the NE tip of the island, formed the Rocche Rosse and Forgia Vecchia obsidian lava flows, which have been dated variously from about 500 to 1230 CE. Objects made of obsidian from Lipari have been found throughout southern Italy.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Spectacular incandescent nighttime explosions at this volcano have long attracted visitors to the &quot;Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.&quot;  Stromboli, the NE-most of the Aeolian Islands, has lent its name to the frequent mild explosive activity that has characterized its eruptions throughout much of historical time. The small island is the emergent summit of a volcano that grew in two main eruptive cycles, the last of which formed the western portion of the island. The Neostromboli eruptive period took place between about 13,000 and 5,000 years ago. The active summit vents are located at the head of the Sciara del Fuoco, a prominent horseshoe-shaped scarp formed about 5,000 years ago due to a series of slope failures that extend to below sea level. The modern volcano has been constructed within this scarp, which funnels pyroclastic ejecta and lava flows to the NW. Essentially continuous mild Strombolian explosions, sometimes accompanied by lava flows, have been recorded for more than a millennium.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The word volcano is derived from Vulcano stratovolcano in Italy&apos;s Aeolian Islands. Vulcano was constructed during six stages over the past 136,000 years. Two overlapping calderas, the 2.5-km-wide Caldera del Piano on the SE and the 4-km-wide Caldera della Fossa on the NW, were formed at about 100,000 and 24,000-15,000 years ago, respectively, and volcanism has migrated north over time. La Fossa cone, active throughout the Holocene and the location of most historical eruptions, occupies the 3-km-wide Caldera della Fossa at the NW end of the elongated 3 x 7 km island. The Vulcanello lava platform is a low, roughly circular peninsula on the northern tip of Vulcano that was formed as an island beginning more than 2,000 years ago and was connected to the main island in about 1550 CE. Vulcanello is capped by three pyroclastic cones and was active intermittently until the 16th century. The latest eruption from Vulcano consisted of explosive activity from the Fossa cone from 1898 to 1900.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Mount Etna, towering above Catania, Sicily&apos;s second largest city, has one of the world&apos;s longest documented records of historical volcanism, dating back to 1500 BCE. Historical lava flows of basaltic composition cover much of the surface of this massive volcano, whose edifice is the highest and most voluminous in Italy.  The Mongibello stratovolcano, truncated by several small calderas, was constructed during the late Pleistocene and Holocene over an older shield volcano. The most prominent morphological feature of Etna is the Valle del Bove, a 5 x 10 km horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the east. Two styles of eruptive activity typically occur, sometimes simultaneously. Persistent explosive eruptions, sometimes with minor lava emissions, take place from one or more summit craters. Flank vents, typically with higher effusion rates, are less frequently active and originate from fissures that open progressively downward from near the summit (usually accompanied by Strombolian eruptions at the upper end). Cinder cones are commonly constructed over the vents of lower-flank lava flows. Lava flows extend to the foot of the volcano on all sides and have reached the sea over a broad area on the SE flank.</SimpleData>

The oldest volcanic rocks are Pliocene submarine rhyolitic pyroclastic-flow deposits overlying basement metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The latest activity during the late Pleistocene was concentrated in the eastern half of the low, U-shaped Mílos Island, forming lava domes and phreatic explosion craters, and on Antimílos Island to the NW, where a composite volcano was constructed.

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Renowned Santorini (Thera), with its steep-walled caldera rim draped by whitewashed villages overlooking an active volcanic island in the center of a caldera bay, is one of the scenic highlights of the Aegean. The circular island group is composed of overlapping shield volcanoes cut by at least four partially overlapping calderas. The oldest southern caldera was formed about 180,000 years before present (BP), followed by the Skaros caldera about 70,000 years BP, and then the Cape Riva caldera about 21,000 years BP. The youngest caldera formed about 3600 years BP during the Late-Bronze-Age Minoan eruption  that forced abandonment of the thriving Aegean Sea island. Post-Minoan eruptions beginning in 197 BCE constructed a series of lava domes and flows that form two islands near the center of the caldera. A submarine eruption took place in 1650 CE outside the caldera NE of Thera. The latest eruption produced a small lava dome and flow in 1950, accompanied by explosive activity.</SimpleData>

Yali is oriented NNE-SSW and contains two distinct segments connected by a narrow isthmus formed of modern reef sediments.  The SW part of the island consists primarily of a layered pumice-fall unit about 200 m thick; the NE part contains rhyolitic obsidian lava flows of similar thickness.

Five large post-caldera lava domes completely fill the western part of the caldera. The NE-most (Boriatiko) and SW-most (Karaviotis) lava domes and flows are significantly younger than the other domes. A sixth post-caldera dome, outside the SW caldera rim, produced lava flows that reached the coast. Historical phreatic eruptions occurred from craters within the caldera between 1422 and 1888.

Most are Pleistocene in age, between about 1.1 million and 10,000 years old. The initial stage produced lava flows from vents along the ring fracture of caldera identified from satellite images. The second and third stages took place along an E-W graben and produced lava flows with ultramafic xenoliths. Although activity was considered to have continued until the beginning of the Holocene (Yilmaz, 1990), or almost to historical times (Borsi et al., 1972), the age of the most recent eruption is not known.</SimpleData>

Growth of the modern volcano began about 0.9 million years ago, following Pliocene caldera collapse of the Kocdag complex. Numerous parasitic cones and lava domes are found mostly on the N flank of the modern edifice, many along radial fissures. The youngest dated rock was from an 83,000-year-old dacitic lava flow, but rhyodacitic eruptions and lava dome growth occurred later at the Perikartin dome. One of the latest documented events was an edifice collapse that produced a large debris avalanche that extended to the east. An early Holocene distal tephra layer in Lebanon was attributed to Erciyes Dagi. Uncertainty remains regarding reported historical eruptions and their possible depiction on Roman Cappadocian coins. Historical accounts possibly referring to eruptions could also be attributed to methane releases from a swamp in the Sultansazligi Basin.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Nemrut Dagi is the westernmost of a group of volcanoes near Lake Van in eastern Anatolia and the only one that has erupted in historical time. It contains a 9 x 5 km caldera partially filled on its western side by a caldera lake. Post-caldera volcanism, of basaltic to rhyolitic composition, initially occurred along the caldera rim and floor. Pyroclastic flows and the emission of glassy obsidian lava flows accompanied construction of lava domes within the caldera; later activity formed a series of cinder cones and lava domes erupted along N-S-trending fissures on the northern flank. The most recent activity has been concentrated along a NNW-trending fissure cutting the eastern caldera floor and extending beyond the north caldera rim; nearly two dozen cinder cones and lava domes were constructed on the caldera floor. Ash layers in Lake Van document numerous Holocene eruptions, and an historical eruption in 1441 CE from a N-flank fissure involved compositionally bimodal lava flows.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Tendürek Dagi, also known as Tendürük Dagi, is an elongated shield volcano that rises above the Dogubayazit plain, near the Iranian border south of Mount Ararat. An E-W summit ridge, developed north of an arcuate caldera structure exposed only on the southern side, contains two well-developed cones. The higher western cone is capped by a steep-walled crater with a trachytic spine at its eastern edge. The flatter eastern crater contains a warm lake. The shield volcano developed during a period when highly mobile lava flows from the western crater covered an area of 500 km2. Following summit caldera formation, numerous flank eruptions took place from N-S-trending fissures, producing viscous trachytic lava domes and flows as well as fluid basaltic pahoehoe flows that extend 10-20 km N and S. The latest activity formed two major basaltic lava flows from large cones on the NE and SE flanks. An eruption took place from a vent on the SE flank about 2500 years ago, and a gas-and-ash eruption took place in 1855.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The double-peaked stratovolcano Mount Ararat, also known as Agri Dagi, is Turkey&apos;s highest, largest volume, and easternmost volcano. It is glacier-clad along with its twin volcano, Kucuk Ararat (or Lesser Ararat), and covers an area of 1000 km2 at the eastern end of a SSW-ESE line of volcanoes extending from Nemrut Dagi. Construction of the Greater and Lesser Ararat volcanoes was followed by a period of extensive flank eruptions, many erupted along N-S fissures. The initial stage of flank eruptions produced a cluster of cinder cones and dacitic-rhyolitic lava domes surrounding Greater Ararat and a series of pyroclastic cones and domes on the W flank of Lesser Ararat. Late-stage activity formed large pyroclastic cones lower on the flanks of the two volcanoes. Ararat appears to have been active during the 3rd millennium BCE; pyroclastic-flow deposits overlie early Bronze Age artifacts and human remains. Karakhanian et al. (2002) reported historical evidence for a phreatic eruption and pyroclastic flow at the time of a July 1840 earthquake and landslide.</SimpleData>

Several of these were considered to be of Holocene age, but later Potassium-Argon dating indicated mid- to late-Pleistocene ages. The youngest lower-flank flows have not been precisely dated, but are constrained as occurring between the end of the late-Pleistocene and 3000 BCE (Kharakanian et al., 2003). A 13-km-long, WSW-ENE-trending line of craters and pyroclastic cones cuts across the northern crater rim and is the source of young lava flows and lahars; the latter were considered to be characteristic of Holocene summit eruptions.</SimpleData>

Oswald (1906) noted that steep escarpments of Nummulitic limestones faced the “Dalykh-tapa” volcano, about 6 km NE across an extensive lava-flow field. Near the north end of the approximately 5 x 8 km flow field the 1.5-km-diameter cone rises about 300 m above the surrounding lavas, identified by Sviatlovsky (1959) as post-glacial. At the southern end of the flow field a fissure-fed lava flow several thousand years ago dammed the Arpah River near the town of Vyke and then flowed NW for 6 km; the flows overlie an Upper Pleistocene terrace and have little soil development (Karakhanian et al., 2002). The youthful-looking Smbatassar cinder cone, 17 km NW of Vaiyots-Sar, appears to be the source vent for Holocene lava flows that traveled 11 km N and 17 km S down two valleys (Karakhanian et al., 2002).</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The mid-Pleistocene Porak volcano lies in the Vardenis volcanic highland about 20 km SE of Lake Sevan. The volcanic field straddles the Armenia/Azerbaijan border, and lava flows extend into both countries. The flanks are dotted with 10 satellitic cones and fissure vents. It was constructed along the active Pambak-Sevan strike-slip fault, which has bisected the mid-Pleistocene Khonarassar volcano, separating its two halves by about 800 m. Two large lava flows traveled up to 21 km north and NW, and fresh-looking lava flows form peninsulas extending into Lake Alagyol. Fifth century BCE petroglyphs were interpreted to depict volcanic eruptions (Karakhanian et al., 2002). Porak is referred to in a famous cuneiform inscription as Mount Bamni, and stratigraphic and archeological evidence indicates that an explosive eruption also producing a lava flow occurred at the time of a military battle dated to 782-773 BCE.</SimpleData>

The volcanic field straddles the Armenia/Azerbaijan border, and lava flows extend into both countries. This lava flow is the youngest of the volcanic field. Another flow from the same cone (located in Armenia) flowed into Lake Alagyol in Azerbaijan. Archaeological and historical evidence indicates several eruptions occurred during the Holocene.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">A group of pyroclastic cones is located in the central part of the Siunik volcanic ridge along the Armenia/Azerbaijan border about 60 km SE of Lake Sevan. The Tskhouk-Karckar volcano group was constructed within offset segments of the major Pambak-Sevan strike-slip fault trending SE from Lake Sevan. Eight pyroclastic cones produced three generations of Holocene lava flows (Karakhanian et al., 2002). Abundant petroglyphs, burial kurgans, and masonry walls were found on flows of the older two age groups, but not on the youngest. Lava flows from cinder cones of the Tskhouk-Karckar volcano group overlie petroglyphs dated to the end of the 4th millennium and beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE and are themselves used in gravesites dated at 4720 +/- 140 yrs ago. Following these eruptions, the area was not repopulated until the Middle Ages.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The basaltic Jebel at Tair volcano rises from a 1,200 m depth in the south-central Red Sea, forming an oval-shaped island about 3 km long.  Jebel at Tair (one of many variations of the name, including Djebel Teyr, Jabal al Tayr, and Jibbel Tir ) is the northernmost known Holocene volcano in the Red Sea and lies SW of the Farisan Islands.  Youthful basaltic pahoehoe lava flows from the steep-sided central vent, Jebel Duchan, cover most of the island.  They drape a circular cliff cut by wave erosion of an older edifice and extend beyond it to form a flat coastal plain.  Pyroclastic cones are located along the NW and S coasts, and fumarolic activity occurs from two uneroded scoria cones at the summit.  Radial fissures extend from the summit, some of which were the sources of lava flows.  The island is of Holocene age, and explosive eruptions were reported in the 18th and 19th centuries.</SimpleData>

An early explosive phase was followed by a brief period of marine erosion, then by renewed explosive activity accompanied by the extrusion of basaltic pahoehoe lava flows. This latest phase of activity occurred on the morphologically youngest islands of Zubair, Centre Peak, Saba, and Haycock. Historical explosive activity was reported from Saddle Island in the 19th century. Spatter cones and pyroclastic cones were erupted along fissures that form the low spine of Zubair Island.

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Alid is an isolated, dissected volcano in the central Danakil depression. Elongated in an E-W direction perpendicular to the orientation of the Alid graben, it consists of a structural dome of uplifted sedimentary rocks rising 700 m above the graben floor, which was produced by intrusion of a silicic magma body. The dome is capped by steep-sided basaltic-to-rhyolitic lava flows. Late-stage eruptions during the late Pleistocene ejected rhyolitic pumice. A 2 x 3 km graben cuts the top of the dome, and the crater that produced the Plinian eruption occupies the western third of the summit depression.  Vast lava fields of probable Holocene age originating from fissure vents bank up against the flanks to the NW and SE. Small cones and craters that were the source of the flows are localized along NNW-trending fissures. Fumarolic activity continues from broad areas on the northern summit and flank.</SimpleData>

Fumarolic activity is continuing, and the summit crater contains a small lake with hot mud. Like other Erta Ale Range volcanoes, Gada Ale is considered to be of Holocene age (Barberi and Varet, 1970). A fissure on the SE flank has produced spatter cones and a cinder cone; the latter fed lava flows that reach to Lake Bakili. The symmetrical Catherine tuff ring is located along this same SE trend west of Lake Bakili, and other tuff rings occur on the east side of the lake. A 2-km-wide salt dome to the west has uplifted lava flows as much as 100 m, and the structure of Gada Ale itself appears to be related to salt diapir uplift.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The summit region of Alu, ~5 km NW of the Dalafilla stratovolcano, is an ellipsoidal volcanic horst, elongated NNW-SSE, and formed primarily of older basaltic lava flows. Recent fractures along the axis of the Erta Ale range cut the main horst of Alu and areas to the SSE. Fumarolic activity is located on the numerous parallel faults. Fissure vents west of the horst have fed silicic lava flows, and voluminous youthful basaltic lava flows to the east extend north as far as Lake Bakili. Dalafilla, also referred to as Gabuli, is a steep-sided cone that rises 300 m above surrounding lava fields due to extrusion of viscous, silicic lava flows. Basaltic lava flows from regional fissures surround the volcano. Fumarolic activity occurs in the 100-m-wide summit crater and has weathered surrounding lava flows. The first historical eruption of Alu-Dalafilla took place in 2008, when lava flows from vents between the two edifices traveled NE.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">Bora Ale is a complex volcano located near the center of the Erta Ale Range. The earliest activity formed submarine lava flows partially covered by Quaternary reef deposits. A 4-km-wide shield volcano SW of the main cone is cut by curvilinear faults; youthful chains of spatter cones follow this same pattern and form concentric semi-circles. The summit is located on the NE side of the massif and consists of a silicic stratovolcano that is the largest of the Erta Ale Range. It has produced steep-sided viscous lava flows that have traveled up to 5 km. Strong fumarolic activity occurs within a 300-m-wide summit crater. Regional faulting has fed very recent basaltic lava flows from a NNW-trending fissure that cuts the stratovolcano.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Primary_Photo_Caption">The summit of Borale Ale (upper left) consists of a silicic stratovolcano that is the largest of the Erte Ale Range. Spatter cones aligned along regional fissures can be seen in the foreground and an altered lava dome forms the light-colored cone above the fissures. Strong fumarolic activity occurs within a 300-m-wide crater on the 668-m-high summit of the volcano. Regional faulting has resulted in recent basaltic lava flows from a NNW-trending fissure that cuts the stratovolcano.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Geological_Summary">The Erta Ale basaltic shield volcano is the most active in Ethiopia, with a 50-km-wide edifice that rises more than 600 m from below sea level in the barren Danakil depression. It is the namesake and most prominent feature of the Erta Ale Range. The volcano includes a 0.7 x 1.6 km elliptical summit crater hosting steep-sided pit craters. Another larger 1.8 x 3.1 km wide depression elongated parallel to the trend of the Erta Ale range is located SE of the summit and is bounded by curvilinear fault scarps on the SE side. Fresh-looking basaltic lava flows from these fissures have poured into the caldera and locally overflowed its rim. The summit caldera usually also holds at least one long-term lava lake that has been active since at least 1967, or possibly since 1906. Recent fissure eruptions have occurred on the N flank.</SimpleData>

					<SimpleData name="Primary_Photo_Caption">The summit of Erta Ale contains a 0.7 x 1.6 km elliptical caldera containing pit craters. A plume rises from the N pit at the left, and a lava lake was active in the center pit crater at the time of this February 2002 view from the S. It is an isolated basaltic shield volcano that is the most active volcano in Ethiopia. Recent basaltic lava flows fill much of the caldera and have overflowed its rim on the southern side. One, or sometimes two, long-term lava lakes have been active since at least 1967.</SimpleData>
